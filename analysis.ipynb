    "## Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter describes methods for estimating uncertainty of machine learning classification maps and how to use such estimates to improve classification accuracy. Map uncertainty refers to the degree of doubt or ambiguity in the accuracy of each pixel of the classification results. Several sources of uncertainty can arise during land classification using satellite data, including: a) classification errors;   b) ambiguity in classification schema; c) variability in the landscape; and d) limitations of the data. The quality and quantity of input data can influence the accuracy of the classification results. Quantifying uncertainty in land classification is important for ensuring that the results are reliable and valid for decision-making. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Active Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Active learning is an iterative process of sample selection, labeling, and model retraining. The following steps provide a general overview of how to use active learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect initial training samples: Start by collecting a small set of representative training samples that cover the range of land classes of interest.\n",
    "2. Train a machine learning model: Use the initial training samples to train a machine learning model to classify remote sensing data.\n",
    "3. Classify the data cube using the model.\n",
    "4. Identify areas of uncertainty. \n",
    "5. Select samples for re-labeling: Select a set of unlabeled samples that the model is most uncertain about, i.e., those that the model is least confident in classifying.\n",
    "6. Label the selected samples: The user labels the selected samples, adding them to the training set.\n",
    "7. Retrain the model: The model is retrained using the newly labeled samples, and the process repeats itself, starting at step 2.\n",
    "8. Stop when the classification accuracy is satisfactory: The iterative process continues until the classification accuracy reaches a satisfactory level.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional classification methods, experts provide a set of training samples and use a machine learning algorithm to produce a map. By contrast, the active learning approach puts the human in the loop [[3](#ref-monarch2021)]. At each iteration, an unlabeled set of samples is presented to the user, which assigns classes to them and includes them in the training set [[1](#ref-crawford2013)]. The process is repeated until the expert is satisfied with the result, as shown in [Figure 1](#fig-uncert-1). "

    "Active learning aims to reduce bias and errors in sample selection and, as such, improve the accuracy of the result.

    "1.\tClassification errors: These can occur when the classification algorithm misinterprets the spectral, spatial or temporal characteristics of the input data, leading to the misclassification of land classes.\n",
    "2.\tAmbiguity in classification schema: The definition of land classes can be ambiguous or subjective, leading to inconsistencies in the classification results.\n",
    "3.\tVariability in the landscape: Natural and human-induced variations in the landscape can make it difficult to accurately classify land areas.\n",
    "4.\tLimitations of the data: The quality and quantity of input data can influence the accuracy of the classification results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantifying uncertainty in land classification is important for ensuring that the results are reliable and valid for decision-making. Various methods, such as confusion and error matrices, can be used to estimate and visualize the level of uncertainty in classification results. Additionally, incorporating uncertainty estimates into decision-making processes can help to identify regions where further investigation or data collection is needed. \n",

    "\n",
    "The study area is close to the Samuel Hydroelectric Dam, located on the Madeira River in the Brazilian state of Rondônia. Building the dam led to a loss of 56,000 ha of native forest. The dam's construction caused the displacement of several indigenous communities and traditional populations, leading to social and cultural disruption. Additionally, flooding large forest areas resulted in losing habitats and biodiversity, including several endangered species. The dam has altered the natural flow of the Madeira River, leading to changes in water quality and temperature and affecting the aquatic life that depends on the river. The changes in river flow have also impacted the navigation and transportation activities of the local communities [[2](#ref-fearnside2005)].\n",

    "The first step is to produce a regular data cube for the chosen area from 2020-06-01 to 2021-09-01. To reduce processing time and storage, we use only three bands (B02, B8A, and B11) plus the cloud band, and take a small area inside the tile. After obtaining a regular cube, we plot the study area in two dates during the temporal interval of the data cube. The first image is taken at the beginning of the dry season in 2020-07-04, when the inundation area of the dam was covered by shallow water. \n",

In this way, combnining uncertainty with active learning minimizes the number of samples that need to be manually labeled by selecting the most informative ones.\n",
